# Base Style 001

A base style for a multi-format book publication using Fidus Writer, Vivlioytles, Docsify (or another flat file system), and GitHub/Lab.

A Fidus Writer Book Style and accompanying Docsify Style / GitHub/Lab Template.

## The purpose of creating a base book style

A multi-format CSS Book Style is needed for fully automated Fidus Writer multi-format outputting that further styles can be built ontop of. The Base Style is needed that addresses all of the multi-format outputs (PDF screen, PDF PoD, Web Docsify, Web paged (Vivliostyle), Web paged responsive (Vivliostyle) and eBook); that works in the context of the pipeline; within constraints of Fidus Writer system; exploits Vivliostyle features; follows Vivliostyle CSS tooling.

  - The style would be fully commented.
  - Use varaible fonts, if possible.
  - Select a CSS Tooling.
  
 ### Key issues to address are:
 
  - Covers: Multi-format issues
  - Counting of objects: Images, tables, pages, sections, lists, footnotes, citations, etc
  - Special styles and tag of objects: blockquotes, lists, tables, etc
  - Recto, Verso
  - Footnote and citation interlinking
  - Note CSS issues but important for template: Document metadata, parts of document semantic structure tags for LOD (sections, abstract, etc); Contentb LOD structuring using DCMI? (Authors, funding, RoR, etc).
