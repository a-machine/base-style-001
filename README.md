## The purpose of creating Book Base style

The BookBase style is made for book designers to easily make use of multi-format CSS typetting. It aims to simplify the basic style settings as well as automate styling for multi-format publications from a limited set of CSS files to create layouts for: PDF screen; PDF PoD (print); archive PDF, Web Docsify, Webpub - as Paged Media (Vivliostyle), and Web paged responsive (Vivliostyle), and; eBook.

## Objectives

  - Easy to customise and well commented CSS
  - Select CSS tooling for SASS, variables, etc.
  - Compatibility with Fidus Writer, Vivliostyle, and GitLab/Hub
  - Compatibility with Vivlioytle Templates, tools, and methods for CSS typesetting
  - W3C Compliant (where possible)

## Key issues to address are:
 
  - Covers: Multi-format issues
  - Counting of objects: Images, tables, pages, sections, lists, footnotes, citations, etc
  - Special styles and tag of objects: blockquotes, lists, tables, etc
  - Recto, Verso and other page designation
  - Footnote and citation interlinking, and option settings for placing in book: end of chapter, end of book, etc.
  - The style would be fully commented
  - Use varaible fonts, if possible
  - Select a CSS tooling: SASS and variables etc
  - Media queries

### Issues out of scope - but to be included in next work package

Not CSS issues, but important for templates: Document metadata, parts of document semantic structure tags for LOD (sections, abstract, etc.); Content LOD structuring using DCMI? (Authors, funding, RoR, etc).
